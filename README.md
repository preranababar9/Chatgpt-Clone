# Chatgpt-Clone
Created a Chatgpt Clone using python and gradio.
Gradio is an open source python library that allows us to quickly and easily create web-based GUIs for machine learning models and many other functions.
With Gradio, developers can build GUIs with little to no HTML or CSS knowledge, and users can interact with these GUIs through a web browser, without needing to install 
anything locally.
Open AI  is a python library that provides convenient access to the Open AI API from applications written in python programming language.
It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible with a wide range of
versions of the Open AI API.
